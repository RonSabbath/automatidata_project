## Automatidata - Exploratory Data Analytics

### Project Overview
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) stage of the Automatidata project. In this phase, we dive deep into the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) data to gain insights and create visualizations that help us understand taxi ridership patterns.

### Key Highlights
- Utilized Python programming for data structuring and cleaning.
- Employed matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- Generated a box plot of ride durations for a better understanding of variability.
- Created time series plots, breaking down ride data by quarter and month.
- Developed Tableau visualizations, including a map of taxi/limo trips by month, prioritizing accessibility for visually impaired users.

### PACE Strategy
- **Plan**: Defined the scope of EDA, including data structuring and visualization goals.
- **Analyze**: Explored the dataset, identified patterns, and cleaned data for accurate analysis.
- **Construct**: Created meaningful visualizations using Python libraries and Tableau.
- **Execute**: Generated clear and informative visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of taxi ridership in NYC.

### Executive Summary
The EDA phase has successfully provided valuable insights into NYC TLC taxi ridership. The data reveals trends in ride durations, patterns based on time intervals, and geographical distribution of trips. The Tableau dashboard enhances accessibility for all stakeholders, accommodating individuals with visual impairments.

## Automatidata - Statistical Modelling and Hypothesis Testing

### Project Overview
Welcome to the Statistical Modelling and Hypothesis Testing stage of the Automatidata project. In this phase, we focus on analyzing the relationship between fare amount and payment type for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) dataset.

### Key Highlights
- Conducted A/B testing to analyze fare amount by payment type.
- Leveraged Python for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Employed statistical tests to validate findings and draw conclusions.

### PACE Strategy
- **Plan**: Defined the scope of A/B testing, including hypothesis formulation and analysis plan.
- **Analyze**: Conducted A/B testing and analyzed results using Python.
- **Construct**: Employed statistical techniques to draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Execute**: Presented findings and recommendations based on hypothesis testing results.

### Executive Summary
The A/B testing phase has shed light on the relationship between fare amount and payment type. Statistical analysis has confirmed significant differences in fare amounts based on payment methods. These insights provide valuable information for the NYC TLC's decision-making processes.

## Automatidata - Regression Analysis

### Project Overview
Welcome to the Regression Analysis stage of the Automatidata project. In this phase, we aim to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) dataset.

### Key Highlights
- Utilized Python for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fare amounts.
- Incorporated insights from previous stages, including EDA and A/B testing.

### PACE Strategy
- **Plan**: Outlined the regression analysis process, including feature selection and modeling approach.
- **Analyze**: Preprocessed data and engineered features for regression modeling.
- **Construct**: Built a robust multiple linear regression model.
- **Execute**: Presented regression analysis results to stakeholders, highlighting model performance and insights.

### Executive Summary
The regression analysis phase has resulted in a predictive model for taxi fare amounts. By incorporating various features and leveraging insights from earlier stages, we have developed a model that provides accurate fare predictions based on input variables. This model will contribute to informed decision-making for the NYC TLC.

## Automatidata - Building Machine Learning Model

### Project Overview
Welcome to the Building Machine Learning Model stage of the Automatidata project. In this phase, we focus on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a tip for a taxi ride.

### Key Highlights
- Utilized Python for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Developed a machine learning model for binary classification (tip/no-tip).
- Addressed the specific client need of predicting tip behavior for taxi drivers.

### PACE Strategy
- **Plan**: Defined the scope of the machine learning task, including model selection and evaluation metrics.
- **Analyze**: Preprocessed data and engineered features for the classification model.
- **Construct**: Built a robust binary classification model.
- **Execute**: Presented machine learning model results to stakeholders, emphasizing predictive performance and applicability.

### Executive Summary
The machine learning model has been successfully developed to predict tip behavior for taxi rides. By leveraging data-driven insights and employing appropriate classification techniques, we have created a tool that helps taxi drivers identify customers likely to leave tips. This model aligns with the client's objective and contributes to improved service and revenue for taxi drivers.
